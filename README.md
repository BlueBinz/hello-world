Hello World, CS3377 Week 15 Lab

今晩は! Good Evening,

I'm Andrew Gerungan, a Computer Science major at the University of Texas at Dallas; this is actually the final lab for my CS3377.001 course, so I'm excited to be so close to break. I'm actually already familiar with GitHub, so this lab is more of a formality for me.
